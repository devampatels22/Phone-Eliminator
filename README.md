# Phone-Eliminator

Developed an Arduino-based phone eliminator as a side project. 
The device encourages focused work by providing users with a 25-minute phone-free period followed by a 5-minute break. 
The system utilizes a servo motor to lock and unlock a box, a LiquidCrystal display for user interface, and a buzzer to provide feedback. 
It includes features such as countdown timers, emergency pause, and musical tones for user engagement. Implemented functionalities to start/stop timers, handle button presses, and display relevant information on the LCD screen. 
Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills and creativity in combining hardware and software components for a practical application.
